Architecture .net solution

The net solution architecture complies of separated projects that ensure a separation of concerns based on responsabilities. These projects are grouped in folders considering the responsability of each project.

EF6 Database first

Entity Framework 6 is being used as the solution ORM. The Model, Repositories and repositories interfaces are being auto generated from the EDMX using text templates which have been modified to deliver these different structures.

The model, which is being auto generated, include serialization and validation attributes and is included in the Model project which is used across the solution.

Dependency injection using unity

The solution implements a project based on the unity container to handle dependency injection smoothly by loading the dependencies from the dependency dll itself and resolving these from a dependency resolver class in the web api.

For the injection of the repositories the interfaces from which the repositories are implementes are autogenerated from text templates that infer these from the EF edmx generated.
